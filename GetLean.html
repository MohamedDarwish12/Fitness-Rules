            <header class="header">Cut the Calories</header>
            <p>Weightloss is largely determined by calorie intake and control. This is achieved through consuming less calories than the amount you burn each day.</p><!-- This is where the body of your webpage will be written. -->
            <br><P>A calorie deficit is often the way to go. The initial step is to determine how many calories you should be cosuming each day to lose weight.</P>
            <br><p>Eating around 500 fewer calories than you need every day can help you drop the kilos.</p>
            <br><p>On average, young women ages  betweeen 19 to 30 are reccomended that they eat between 2,200-2,400 calories. 31 and above should consume up to 2,200 calories while sedentary women base diets aorund 1,800 calories.</p>
            <br><p>Young men 19 to 30 may eat 2,600 to 2,800 calories. 31 and above are suggested to consime 3,000 and sedentary men intake 2,000 calories.  </p> 
            <br><p> Use this 
                <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">calorie calculator</a> to estimate the number of calories you would need to consume each day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Consume sufficient protein</header>
            <br><p>Protein stimulates appetite inducing hormones GLP-1, peptide YY and cholecystokinin, resulting in an automatic reduction in calorie intake. An additional benefit is that it helps you feel full while on a calorie deficit. </p>
            <br><p>Lean protein foods include chicken, fish, beans, lentils, etc.</p>
            </p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Focus on your Body Fat Percentage</header>
            <br><p>Weight loss refers to a decrease in the overall body weight and is dependent on a variety of factors including dieting and excercise. Fat loss, on the other hand refers to weight lost as a result of reduction in 
                fat and is best accomplished through a combination of regular excercise and a healthy diet that is low in diet and high in protein.</p>
