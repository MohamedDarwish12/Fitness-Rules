            <header class="header">Increase the Calories</header>
            <p>In contrast to achieing a lean physique, you would wabt a positive calorie balance instead (consuming more than you burn.) However,
                 additional calories outside of the body's average limit leads to excess fat gains. To avoid this, a daily increase of 250 to 500 calories is reccomended.</p>
            <P>Training immensely elevates protein turnover. (see section 'your routine guide' for more tips!).
            <br><p> Use this 
                <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">calorie calculator</a> to estimate the number of calories you would need to consume each day.

            <header class="header">diet</header>
            <br><p>Incorporate protein to build and maintain muscle mass. For eveery 454g of body-weight, you should be looking to eat 1g of protein. Say that the average person weighs 71kg, they are expected to consume 156.39g of protein. 
                 </p>
            <br><p> In this case, it is more beneficial to include a whole protein source with each meal, such as:
               <p> <ul id="ulist">
                    <li> Red Meat: Beef, Pork, Lamb.</li>
                    <li>Fish: Tuna, Salmon, Mackerel.</li>
                    <li>Poultry: Chicken, Poultry, Duck.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Eat Healthy fats</header>
            <br><p>Healthy fats improve fat loss and overall health as they digest slowly. Make sure to avoid artificial transfats ad margarine </p>
            
            <br>
            <header class="header">Whole Foods should be the predominant meal</header>
            <br><p>In order to boost muscle mass significantly, 90% of food inake should include wholefoods (unprocessed and unrefined food that come in their natural state). Avoid processed food as much as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Don't Skip Out on Breakfast</header>
            <p>Eating well early in the morning has been proven to aid weight management, with the consumption of protein speeding up your body's recovery and promoting lean muscle growth.</p>
