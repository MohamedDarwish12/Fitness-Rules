        <div class="body">
            <header class="header">Pre-workout</header>
            <p>Pre-workout supplements are typically taken 15-30 minutes before a workout but may also be consumed duiring excercise. The common ingredients found in pre-workout supplements include:</p>
            
            <br>
            <header class="header">Beta Alenine</header>
            <br><p>An amino acid produced in the liver- found in fish, poultry and meat. It has been proven to reduce neuromuscular fatigue and enhances performance in older adults</p>
            <br><p> Acidity from Hydrogen ions produced during excercise reduces the muscle's ability to contract and results in fatigue. The supplement increases carnosine levels which in turn reduces acid levels during high intensity excercise, this reduces the fatigue and enhances athletic performance.</p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Caffeine</header>
            <br><p>Caffeine is a simulamnt that is utilised in  pre-workout supplements for short term high intensity excercise. Caffein increases endorphin release, improves neuromuscular function, vigilance, alertness. Laager doses however (over 9mg/kg of body weight) may have reversed effects where side effects are inducved such as nausea, anxiety, and insomnia.</p>
            <br><p> Acidity from Hydrogen ions produced during excercise reduces the muscle's ability to contract. This results in nfatigue. The supllement increases carnosine levels which in turn reduces acid levels during high intensity excercise, this reduces the fatigue and enhances athletic performance.</p>
            <br><p>The FDA considers 400mg of caffeine to be a safe ampount for daily consumption. It is crucial that you review the label before purchasing as some companies exceed this amounnt and fail to isclose this information.</p>
            <br>
            <header class="header">Creatine</header>
            <br><p>Creatine is a naturall ocurring compoud tht exists in red meat and seafood. It aids the bodyt in producin energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate, increasing the cell's ability to perform work- this is especially beneficial in the muscle. This increases trainingvolume and the capcity for excercise and training. </p>
             
              <p>This is reccomended for individuals who are intending on engaging in weightlifting, or repeated high intensity excercises/sport. (eg. basketball or soccer)</p>
