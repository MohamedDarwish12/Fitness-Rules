         <h1>Shoulder and Upperback</h1>
      <img src="./omgg.png" alt="Muscles"  class="img"/>
      <p>Training your back and shoulders on the same day is a great way to combine these two important muscle groups. This back and <br>shoulder workout routine is designed to build a muscular, strong back and wide, massive shoulder muscles.</p>
      <p>The back workout consists of five exercises: four for your latissimus dorsi muscles, rhomboids, and trapezius, and one for your<br> lower back. A combination of vertical pulls (pull-ups and pulldowns) and rows makes this an excellent back workout for both<br> width and thickness.<br>
<br>
        1.Pull-Up or Lat Pulldown<br>
        2.Barbell Row<br>
        3.Dumbbell Row<br>
        4.Shrugs<br>
        5.Back Extension</p><br>

        <img src="./fish.png" alt="weight lifting" class="img" />
        <p>Who doesn’t love the idea of having nicely sculpted and strong upper back and shoulder muscles? Well, the good news is that this<br> ideal physique isn’t all that hard to achieve. All you need to do is target the right muscles during your workouts and complete the<br>
             appropriate amount of reps and sets to sculpt and tone your muscles.Firstly, if you’re looking to build strength and tone your upper<br> back and shoulder muscles, you’ll want to aim for 3-6 sets of 6-12 repetitions at 67 to 85-percent of your maximum load (the very <br>
             most you can lift for one rep). If you combine this prescription with the following exercises, you’ll be on the road to building<br> 
             upper body strength. Here are my favorite 16 shoulder and back workouts to do just that…<br></p>
        <p>
           1.Standing Shoulder Press<br>
           2.Bent Over Rows<br>
           3.Lateral Raises<br>
           4.Pull-Ups<br>
           5.Face Pulls

       <h1>Upper Body</h1><img  src="./man222.png"  alt="upperbody"   class="img"/>
       <p>When it comes to quality upper body workouts, they all have similar exercises in common.
        Seriously, most workouts you find<br> anywhere are going to have the same exercises with similar rep schemes for the most part. It’s because these exercises train<br> important movement patterns.
        They’re also compound exercises that hit multiple muscle groups in natural ranges of motions.<br> Naturally, this makes them safer to perform and will lead to a better caloric burn during each individual training session.
        For upper<br> body workouts, the most important movement patterns to train are: 
        <p>1.Vertical Pulls<br>
        2.Horizontal Pull<br>
        3.Vertical Push<br>
        4.Horizontal Push<br>
        5.Loaded Carry</p>
